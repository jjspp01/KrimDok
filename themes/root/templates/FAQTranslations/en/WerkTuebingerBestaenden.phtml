              You can usually receive books and journals which are not available at your closest library via
              long-distance loan or via the <a href="http://www.subito-doc.de/index.php?lang=de&mod=page&pid=Dokumentlieferung">
              Subito</a> service.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long-distance loans are covered by an agreement between the libraries to exchange academic literature
             (e.g., monographies and articles) amongst their users as required.  The legal basis for this are the provisions
             of the "Ordnung des Leihverkehrs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland"
             (<a href="https://wiki.bsz-bw.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=fl-team:leihverkehrsordnung.pdf">Leihverkehrsordnung</a>).

             What cannot be checked out under this system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  Books and articles which are available in your closest library (this includes books currently on loan as well
                  as books available in a reading room or departmental library),
                </li>
                <li>
                  Works which you yourself can purchase for a low price (approx. €10),
                </li>
                <li>
                  Recent journals and recent bound journals.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can order a work on long-distance loan via the library system in your library - if you cannot find what
              you are looking for in your library. The work you need can be ordered by long-distance loan from another
              library. You have the option of ordering an article out of a journal. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A processing fee of €1.50 will be charged for each long-distance order - regardless of whether the work can
              be delivered or not. The process usually takes about 1-3 weeks.
