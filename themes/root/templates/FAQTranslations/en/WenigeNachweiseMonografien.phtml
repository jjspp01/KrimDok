              As far as monographs go, KrimDok is first and foremost a collection for the Criminology information service
              and the Institute of Criminology at the University of TÃ¼bingen. In categories of general and for criminology
              only marginally relevant areas (e.g., drugs, sexuality, alcohol, etc.), we have only been able to expand our
              collection by limiting acquisitions to the most relevant literature, due to financial constraints.
