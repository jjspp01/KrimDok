            <p> KrimDok is a bibliographical reference system of criminology literature. The database brings
               together various collections of literature and catalogues which were originally arranged according
               to different aspects. You can now search the titles listed via a search mask.
            </p>
            <p> The collection of the
                <a href="http://www.jura.uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/ifk">Instituts für Kriminologie in Tübingen</a>
                is largely based on German-language titles; however the collection of the
                <a href="http://www.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/ueber-uns/fachgebiete/kriminologie-fid.html">
                  Fachinformationsdiensts Kriminologie</a> in the Tübingen University Library has a large proportion
                of non-German literature (largely monographs).  Non-stand-alone works (e.g. articles) are included in
                KrimDok via an assortment of key international serial publications.
            </p>
            <p> Apart from criminology, basic related disciplines are included as far as possible, above all in the
              broadest sense of criminologically-relevant publications and legal publications of general interest
              in criminology due to their parallel nature (criminal law, criminal procedure, sentencing, penal law),
              law in action, crime detection and police investigation, psychology (particularly forensic and legal
              psychology as well as social psychology), psychiatry (particularly forensic psychiatry, involuntary
              treatment), sociology (particularly sociology of law, criminal sociology) and pedagogy (and social work).

              The collection of the Institute of Criminology in Tübingen, both monographies and a selection of journals
              (mostly German-language publications) to the end of 2014 are incorporated via local (non-standardized)
              keywords (generally speaking, from 1990, and selectively before that). Additionally, monographies are
              ordered by keywords according to Germany’s RSWK (Regeln für den Schlagwortkatalog) system.

              Items in the collection of the Institute of Criminology information service (Fachinformationsdienst) - which
              largely includes non-German-language publications but also has some German-language publications, have
              keywords according to RSWK.  Or search the German Research Foundation-backed project
              <a href="http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/digitue/krimdok/">DigiKrimDok</a>.  Entries here also have
              standardized keywords according to RSWK. A large part of the Heidelberg essay archive was included, thanks
              to German Research Foundation sponsorship. The essays/papers here also have standardized keywords according to RSWK.
