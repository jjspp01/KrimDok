<h1>A Criminological Example</h1>

<p>Some queries are more complex and a simple search query is insufficient. For example, if you are looking for titles concerning
    the historical development of the <i>rehabilitation</i> approach in <i>Germany</i>.  When you enter the search terms
    <i>rehabilitation</i> and <i>Germany</i>  into the upper two search fields with the match criterion "ALL Terms", your result
    list will contain titles covering <i>rehabilitation</i> and <i>Germany</i>. If you choose the condition "ANY Terms",
    you will additionally find titles which will only reference <i>Germany</i> but not <i>rehabilitation</i> as well as
    titles which reference only <i>rehabilitation</i> but not <i>Germany</i>.
<p>For an even more complex query you may add additional search fields by clicking on "Add Search Field".  (You can remove
    a search field by clicking on the "x" following its associated field selection dropdown menu.)
    With the dropdown menu below "Match:" you can select whether every search result must include all search terms or only
    some of the search terms.  The example mentioned above can be realised as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter <i>rehabilitation</i> into the uppermost search field and <i>Germany</i> into the one below it and select the
        match criterion "ALL Terms" in the match dropdown.
    </li>
    <li>Add an additional search group by clicking on "Add Search Group".  Then add a new search field in the new group by
        clicking on "Add Search Field".  Now enter the terms <i>history</i> and <i>development</i> into the two search fields
        of the new search group.  Select the match condition "ANY Term" for this new search group and start your search by
        clicking on the read "Find" button.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The search result list will now contain titles which cover <i>rehabilitation</i> AND <i>Germany</i> and imply a temporal
   progression by including the terms <i>history</i> or <i>development</i>.

<h3>An Example Demonstrating Minimisation of the Result List:</h3>
    <p>If you would like to exclude terms from the result list, e.g., exclude results that contain the word <i>Germany</i>
    from the list of results of a search for <i>penal system</i> please proceed as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Enter <i>penal system</i> into the topmost search field and set the match criterion to "ALL Terms".
    </li>
    <li>Add another search group and enter <i>Germany</i> into its search field.  Set the new group's match criterion to
        "NO Terms" and execute your search.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You will now get hits mentioning <i>penal system</i> but <i>Germany</i> in neither the title nor in any other field
   (e.g. the keywords).
<p>To also exclude related terms you can use a search operator, in this case, the asterisk:
<p>german*
<p>Through this choice you would exclude <i>Germany</i>, <i>German</i>, <i>Germans</i> etc.</p>
<p>You can arbitrarily adjust your search by clicking on the link "Edit this Advanced Search" in the header above your
    search result list.  By clicking on "Search History" in the footer of the search result list you can reissue a
    previous search.
